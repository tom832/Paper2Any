Minimal test for wf_paper2page_content

- Input PDF: dev_2/DataFlow-Agent/tests/2506.02454v1.pdf
- Workflow: dataflow_agent.workflow.wf_paper2page_content.create_paper2page_content_graph

Notes:
- This test focuses on graph wiring + MinerU markdown reading node.
- The outline agent name used in the workflow is "paper2page_outline_agent".
  If you haven't registered that agent role yet, this test will likely fail at outline_agent step.
  You can still verify the PDF->MinerU->markdown-read stage by temporarily bypassing the outline agent.

    # Technical Solutions

The technical solutions available span the entire waste management chain:

1. Collection and Segregation: The foundation of effective waste management begins with reliable collection services and proper waste segregation. Without these fundamentals, downstream interventions have limited impact.

2. Recycling Technologies:

Mechanical Recycling: Processing plastics through sorting, cleaning, and reprocessing into new products.   
。 Chemical Recycling: Breaking plastic polymers down into their chemical building blocks for reuse.

3. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Systems: Converting non-recyclable plastics to energy through various thermal processes.

4. Cleanup Technologies: Specialized equipment for removing plastic from rivers, coastlines, and the ocean.

Recent cost-benefit analyses provide insights into the economic viability of these solutions. For instance, a study by Agori et al. (2024) in Ughelli, Nigeria, evaluated four mitigation strategies over a 0.5-year horizon at a $1 0 \%$ discount rate:

![](/data/users/liuzhou/online/Paper2Any/outputs/paper2page_content/1767785456/2512.16676v1/auto/images/ba397b4c85a1c1bd0022e9dd145db42f9ab3f956df48273d92694b3cad820a48.jpg)  
Cost-Benefit Analysis of Plastic Waste Management Strategies in Ugheli, Nigeria   
Collection & recycling shows highest returns among evaluated interventions

The results show that plastic waste collection and recycling delivered the highest returns with a Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR) of 1.50 and Net Present Value (NPV) of ₦112,500,000, followed by household waste segregation (CBR 1.35, NPV ₦80,000,000), public awareness campaigns (CBR 1.28, NPV ₦52,500,000), and deposit-refund schemes (CBR 1.08, NPV ₦25,000,000).

In terms of waste-to-energy systems, Khwammana & Chaiyata (2025) reported on a waste-toenergy-to-zero system that uses municipal solid waste (17.85 tonnes/day at $3 1 . 6 3 \%$ combustible) to fuel a combined cooling, heating, and power plant. The system delivers 306.98 kW at $2 2 . 3 8 \%$ efficiency, yielding a levelized energy cost of 0.15 USD/kWh, NPV of 1,634,658 USD, profitability index of 1.72, internal rate of return of $7 . 9 7 \%$ , and payback period of 9.63 years.

Clement's (2012) Fort Bliss WtE/CSP hybrid cost-benefit study shows that NPV is highly sensitive to the gap between local tariff and WtE rate. Using EPA's WARM model for 1 million tonnes/year feedstock, the Fort Bliss WtE diversion avoids approximately 264,025 MTCO2e annually. At carbon credit prices ranging from 0.10-10 USD/MTCO2e, 20-year environmental benefits range from $\$ 0.4$ million to $\$ 36.2$ million USD.
